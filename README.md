Project Idea: Advanced Diary Application

**Overview**

Categorized Notes: Users can create and manage notes in different categories (e.g., personal, work, travel).
Archiving: Users can archive notes to keep their diary organized.
Public Diaries and Comments: Users can make certain diary entries public and allow other users to comment on them.
User Reporting: Users can report inappropriate content or behavior.
User Blocking: Users can block other users to prevent interaction.
Notifications: Implement notifications for comments, reports, and other relevant activities.
